# Find My Musician

## Description

We were motivated to connect like minded musicians who are interest in playing music with other fellow musicians.
We thought it would be cool to create an app that all musicians at different levels could interact for the reason of
playing music with other fellow musicians. We created a web app  and data base where fellow musicians can sign into an account
and put in there information so other musicians can look through and reply to other users expressing there interest to meet
them and possibly creating and playing music. 
This is a quick way for like minded musician with similar interest and ablilies
to get together and play music.
